202j=\ 4cr This course extends the treatment of object-oriented methodologies, languages and tools begun in CSC201J. The emphasis is on the analysis of complex problems, particularly those involving multiple design alternatives, and the use of class libraries. Specific topics include inheritance, polymorphism, recursion, stream and file I/O, exceptions, and graphical interface programming.

200a=\ This course provides an overview of fundamental areas within the field of Computer Science, introducing basic vocabulary, central concepts, and typical applications. The areas surveyed include computer hardware, computer arithmetic, operating systems, programming constructs, programming languages, information storage and retrieval, databases, networking, (continued 200a2)
200a2=\ and the social context of computing. Three lecture hours per week. This course satisfies the Computer Literacy Competency-Based Skills requirement.   Prerequisites\: fulfillment of the Basic Mathematics Competency Based Skills requirement and ability to use standard computer software (e.g., operating system features, word processing, email, and web browsers).
201j3=\ specifications are emphasized throughout. Three lecture hours and three hours of scheduled laboratory per week plus extensive programming work outside of class.   Prerequisites\: High school algebra I & II, plus experience with a window-based operating system and the use of email and a word processor.
201j2=\ for the languages and tools currently in use.) Topics such as problem specification, object-oriented analysis and design, standard data types, control structures, methods and parameter passing, and design for reuse are presented through a study of specific example problems and solutions. Style, documentation, solution robustness, and conformance with (continued 201j3)
201j=\  This course introduces a set of fundamental design principles and problem-solving techniques for the development of computer algorithms and their implementation as programs. Problem solutions are developed with the help of an appropriate modeling language and then coded in an object-oriented programming language. (Consult the Computer Science Department (continued 201j2)
